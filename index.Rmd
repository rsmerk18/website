## Filtering Rows and Columns

In SQL you can filter rows by using WHERE and columns by using SELECT. Let's look at an example by using the Lahman baseball database. First, we ahould load the Lahman package. We will also need the sqldf package.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose we want to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. We could write:

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting
where teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```

### Order By

With SQL we can also order the rows in the output. For example; suppose we want to see every instance of a playr hitting more than 50 HR but youd like the player with the most HR to be at the top. Do the following:

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,yearID,teamID,HR from Batting 
where HR>50
order by HR desc"

sqldf(query)
```
